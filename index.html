        <p>
          Steve and Mia met at Cadillac Ranch, a country line dancing bar, Friday, January 13, 2012.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a setup by a mutual friend, Katie Bailer who had been trying for a long time to get us both in the same place at the same time. Mia was working for a non-profit victim advocacy organization and Steve was studying to get his Masters and working for Eversource.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing about Steve that struck Mia, besides being an Accountant which she thought must meant he was boring, was that when she told him what she did for work, he actually seemed interested. So she gave him a chance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The song Like the Rain by Clint Black came on and he asked her to dance. She figured, heck its a new year, why not. He literally swept her off her feet and they danced around for the next two songs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite having been in the same place at the same time multiple times at UCONN, they always say it wasn't meant to be until it really was. Within a year they had moved in together and were talking about the future. Now, 6 years later, they have a house, a rabbit and a dog.
